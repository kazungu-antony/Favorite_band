                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p class="band-intro">
                    Sauti Sol is one of the famous bands in kenya. The group name translates to<i>Voice in the Sun</i>and it was founded in 2005 
                    by three of the band members. The band has four members; Bien-Aime Barasa, Willis Chimano, 
                    Savara Mudigi and Polycarp Otieno. Apart from Otieno, the others have been together for 15 years and have also
                    gone to the same High school.Baraza met Otieno at Aliance Francais in Nairobi where he was perfoming and later 
                    on joined the team to form the band. The band produces very interesting, catching and unique songs. The taste
                    of tradional music and the Rhumba scensation in their music always makes me want to hear their songs more and more. Their facinating beats and grooves
                    always makes one want to dance.
